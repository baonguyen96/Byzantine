# Implementation

This project's communication protocol implements [Lamport's clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps) to ensure distributed synchronization. _Some additional details regarding behaviors will be further addressed in the [Test plan](#test-plan) section below._

## Server communication

When a server starts, it creates 2 threads and does the following:
1. Tries to open socket to other servers (its peers)
2. Accepts new connection request (either from other servers or from clients)

Upon accepting new open socket, the server creates new thread per connection to handle them all concurrently (non-blocking from each other).

For any message the server receives, it then updates its local time to ensure the local time is no smaller than the timestamp of the message (per Lamport's logic). After it finishes processing a message, the server also increments its local time to advance the clock.

If the server needs to write to the file, it has to talk to other servers to ensure mutually synchronized by doing the followings:
1. Sends a Write Acquire Request message to every servers and put the message onto its queue
2. Waits for all Write Acquire Response message from every other servers regarding the request it just sent
3. Proceeds to critical section (write to the file)
4. Sends a Write Release Request to every servers to free the lock
5. Exits critical section

The logic above is proven by Lamport's paper: _L. Lamport. Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System. Communications of the ACM, 21(7):558â€“565, July 1978._

## Client communication

When a client starts, it tries to create sockets to connect to all servers. Then in a loop, it does the following:
1. Randomly decides if should read or write
2. Randomly decides the file number
3. Runs the [algorithm](#hash-function) below to choose which server(s) to send request to
4. Displays server's response or error message

Since at any given time the client only needs to do one thing (send either read or write request), it does not need multiple threads to handle any of its workflow. So the execution path is top down.

Before sending any message, the client increments its local time to advance the clock. For any message the client receives, it then updates its local time to ensure the local time is no smaller than the timestamp of the message (per Lamport's logic).

## Hash function
Per this requirements:
> There exists a hash function, H, such that for each object, Ok, H(Ok) yields a value in the range 0 - 6

The client implements this hash function by given a (object) number n, its hash value is `H(n) = n mod 7`. This ensures the hash value of the object is always between 0 and 6 to fit the 7 servers.

Per this requirement:
> Compute 3 servers numbered: H(Ok), H(Ok)+1 modulo 7, and H(Ok)+2 modulo 7

The client simply uses the value `H(n)` from above to come up with these hashes per servers respectively: `H(n)`, `(H(n) + 1) mod 7`, and `(H(n) + 2) mod 7`

# Test plan

Since the workflow complexity of this project is relatively high due to the amount of distinct moving parts (7 servers and 5 clients, each supports multiple flows), it is quite hard trying to test everything together. So in this test plan, I will break down the flows by directly modify some flags of the code to restrict to only 1 path at a time, prove that part works, then move on to the next. Finally, I will let everything run as of production code would, and show the final outputs from a couple of clients' and servers' consoles as well as output files.

## Single client reads

For this flow, I want the client to only requests random read from different servers. The files may or may not exist yet. 

[ClientNode](../Client/src/main/java/ClientNode.java):

Turn on Debug mode by the following setting:
```java
private final boolean IS_DEBUGGING = true;
private Logger logger = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.Debug);
```

Limit the flow to read-only and the file randomness:
```java
if (IS_DEBUGGING) {
    needToWrite = false;
    fileNumber = random.nextInt(4);
}
```

[ServerNode](../Server/src/main/java/ServerNode.java):

Turn on Debug mode by the following setting:
```java
private Logger logger = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.Debug);
```

Follow [these steps](../README.md#how-to-run) to build and run.

For this test case, I choose _client0_ to connect and read from different servers. I only spin up odd servers (1, 3, 5) and leave the even ones off so that _client0_ won't be able to connect to them. In each of these servers' file directory, I have prepared the following files:
1. File1.txt: `Server1 File1 Line1`
2. File3.txt: `Server1 File3 Line1`

_Sample client's console:_

```

When a client randomly select 1 out of 3 possible servers to send read request, if that server is unreachable, then the client proceeds to the next server to issue request until it runs out of all servers (all are unreachable) then it will display an error message. If any of the 3 servers is reachable to handle the read request, the client will display the result of that server - regardless of the response of that server: Success acknowledgement means the file exists and can read (return along with the its content), Failure acknowledgement means the file does not exist to read.

_Sample server's console:_
```text
> server3 starts listening on (localhost:1373)... at time: 2020-03-16 at 14:50:40.910 CDT
> server3 receives new request from Socket[addr=/127.0.0.1,port=64452,localport=1373] at time: 2020-03-16 at 14:51:26.619 CDT

```

When a server receives a client's read request for a particular file, if the file exists in its file system then the server sends a success acknowledgement that contains the content of the file back to the client; otherwise it sends a failure acknowledgement back.

Note that in this example, a single client reads multiple servers. But spinning up other client instances will not affect the read behavior because the servers do not have to talk to each other when receiving the read request (see protocol above).

## Single client writes

For this flow, I want the client to only requests random write from different servers. The files may or may not exist yet. If the file being requested does not exist, the server will automatically create the file before writing to it.

[ClientNode](../Client/src/main/java/ClientNode.java):

Turn on Debug mode by the following setting:
```java
private final boolean IS_DEBUGGING = true;
private Logger logger = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.Debug);
```

Limit the flow to write-only and the file randomness:
```java
if (IS_DEBUGGING) {
    needToWrite = false;
    fileNumber = random.nextInt(4);
}
```

[ServerNode](../Server/src/main/java/ServerNode.java):

Turn on Debug mode by the following setting:
```java
private Logger logger = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.Debug);
```

Follow [these steps](../README.md#how-to-run) to build and run.

For this test case, I choose _client0_ to connect and write to different servers (1, 2, 3) and leave the rest off so that _client0_ won't be able to connect to them.

```

When _client0_ tries to write to _File6.txt_, it should connects to _server6_, _server0_, and _server1_ according to the [hash function](#hash-function) implemented above. But since it can only connect to _server1_, the write is not permitted. Same situation applied when _client0_ tries to write to _File4.txt_ (in this case none of the server is available.) 

When _client0_ tries to write to _File7.txt_ ("message #2"), however, it should connects to _server0_, _server1_, and _server2_ according to the [hash function](#hash-function) implemented above. Since it can connect to both _server1_ and _server2_, the write is permitted. The client then proceeds to send the write request to all connectible servers (_server1_ and _server2_) and waits for their responses before moving on.

```

The above snippet from the server shows a lot of behind the scene information since it is running in debug mode. Here are some explanations.

On the first part:
1. _server1_ receives ClientWriteRequest to write "message #2" to _File7.txt_ from _client0_
2. _server1_ adds the message onto its queue and broadcasts the WriteAcquireRequest to all servers
3. _server1_ receives WriteAcquireResponse from all servers and proceed critical section
4. _server1_ writes "message #2" to _File7.txt_ and broadcasts WriteSyncRequest so that all other servers can do the same
5. _server1_ finishes with its critical section and broadcasts WriteReleaseRequest so that other servers can proceed with theirs respective critical sections

On the second part:
1. _server1_ receives WriteAcquireRequest from _server3_
2. _server1_ adds the message onto its queue
3. _server1_ replies with WriteAcquireResponse message to allow _server3_ from proceeding
4. _server1_ receives WriteSyncRequest from _server3_ to write "client0 message #18" to _File1.txt_. Note that this is a relay message since the _client0_ requests _server3_ to write, and _server3_ asks other servers to run the synchronization protocol
5. Since _server1_ already wrote the same message earlier (_client0_ sent the same request to _server1_), it detects this is a duplicated request and does not write the same message again

Here is a screenshot of the generated files from the servers. Note that each file is replicated exactly the same among all connected servers, and none yields duplicated rows.

![Single client writes](./Img/SingleClientWritesOutput.PNG)

## Multiple clients write

The workflow for multiple clients requesting write concurrently is essentially the same compare to the previous flow. The server uses the same idea to logically ordered messages and ensures all copies of the files have the same order.

I still use the same settings as the previous test, except that this time I enable 3 clients: _client0_, _client1_, and _client2_.

![Multiple client writes](./Img/MultipleClientWritesOutput.PNG)

# Production

To enable full production workflow (multiple clients connect to multiple servers simultaneously with read/write requests and no debugging outputs), change the followings:

[ClientNode](../Client/src/main/java/ClientNode.java):
```java
private final boolean IS_DEBUGGING = false;
private Logger logger = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.Release);
```

[ServerNode](../Server/src/main/java/ServerNode.java):
```java
private Logger logger = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.Release);
```

Follow [these steps](../README.md#how-to-run) to build and run.

Both client and server now allow both read and write requests. Server admits multiple concurrent requests from multiple clients, and a client triggers multiple write requests as per requirements. At the end the clients gracefully exit. Output files are the similar to [here](#multiple-clients-write). _Note that since the server has multiple threads to handle the communications so that they are non-blocking, the console of the servers shows out of order messages (receives some other servers' responses or clients' requests during broadcasting process), but the priority queue maintains the correct order (as shown in [debug output](#single-client-writes) earlier), same for the output files._
